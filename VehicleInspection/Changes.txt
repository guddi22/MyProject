Throw exceptions when false after prints
Indentation 
Create isNullOrEmpty and use it
Make a Utils.java static class and move functions into it like isInt, isNullOrEmpty etc into it and use it

InspectionResult is in 2 places - make it one


Fix naming everywhere

getRecommendedInspectionWithoutHistory and withHistory make it private

static RecomendedInspections getRecomendedInspections(vehicleDTO) {
  check if this has history
     -- if yes, get from history ones which have failed
     -- else -- loop through all inspections, and return all of them
}

performInspections(getRecommendedInspectionWithoutHistory

VehicleInspectionHistory -- map of vehicledto to { arraylist<(inspection, pass/fail, date)> }
